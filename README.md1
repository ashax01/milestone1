Project Overview
This project is a personal portfolio website created as part of Project 1 for my web development course.

The aim of the website is to provide a simple and professional space where I can introduce myself, show example projects, and demonstrate the skills I have learned so far using HTML and CSS.

The website is designed to be clear, easy to navigate, and responsive on different screen sizes.

Design Choices
The website design was kept minimal and clean to ensure readability.
